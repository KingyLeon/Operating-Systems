## Overview

The coursework aims to provide a practical understanding of fundamental operating system concepts through hands-on implementations. Each task focuses on a different area of operating systems.

## Tasks

### Task A

This task implements basic command-line utilities inspired by Unix commands.

#### Features

- **cat**: Outputs the contents of a file.
- **cut**: Extracts sections from each line of input.
- **sort**: Sorts lines of text alphanumerically.
- **uniq**: Removes duplicate lines.
- **wc**: Counts lines, words, and characters.

#### Usage

Run the program to enter commands directly in the console.

### Task B

Task B explores process management and memory management concepts.

#### Features

- Implements various utilities for managing processes.
- Simulates interaction between processes.

### Task C

Task C simulates virtual memory management using a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).

#### Features

- Simulates TLB behavior.
- Processes virtual addresses and checks for hits, misses, and page faults.
- Outputs results to a file, including TLB and page table status.
